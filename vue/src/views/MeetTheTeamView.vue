          <p>I offer 10+ years of experience working directly with customers over the phone and in person, primarily in customer support. I have completed two certifications from Duke University. The first certification is in Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, while the second certification is in Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software. Although I havenâ€™t worked directly in IT, my customer support experience has helped me build skills in communication, persuasion, and problem-solving. Which I believe will translate well into assessing, identifying, and resolving customer specific solutions within an IT setting. I am also actively working to continue to build my portfolio and knowledge within IT and I am looking forward to networking with others within the IT profession.</p>

          <p>Hello! My name is Jamesson. Thanks for taking the time to get to know a little about me. When I was an elementary school I used to get in trouble all the time for getting out of my seat and helping other students finish their work when I was done. As I got older that mindset carried with me into the work place. I find that helping my peers get tasks done is an extremely rewarding opportunity to not only help others but build a positive workplace. Even when I was in a captain position at a previous role which involved leading peers and making sure all of our objectives were met on time, I would constantly help my teammates with their individual tasks to not only help them but help the overall success of the job. The IT field has been a career I've always wanted to jump into and now I finally have had the chance. I want to know and learn as much as I can and thrive in the opportunities presented to me. Once again thank you for taking the time to read my little paragraph. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feel free to just connect with me!</p>
